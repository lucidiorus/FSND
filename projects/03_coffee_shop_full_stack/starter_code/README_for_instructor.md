# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Instructions for reviewer

All the basic task have been completed in the corresponding files, auth.py, api.py.

To test the API, it is needed to use the new Postman collection called finished_udacity-fsnd-udaspicelatte.postman_collection located in the backend folder

The instructions to run the backend are the sames given by the exercise and are written down in the readme of the backend folder.

The JWTs have an expiration time of 24 hours so they should long for about 22 hours more from the moment I am submitic the project.

Hope it is easy to test the project.
